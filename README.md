# Voxa
Voxa is a lightweight, Twitter-inspired microblogging platform where users share their thoughts in short posts called voices. Built with Django and PostgreSQL, Voxa provides a clean, modern social experience while giving me hands-on practice with Python, web development, and deployment workflows.
